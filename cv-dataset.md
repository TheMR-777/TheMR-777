## Personal Journey & Philosophy

### The Genesis (Age 3-10)
My journey with computers began at age 3, influenced by my uncle ("Mamu"), a tech enthusiast and computer science teacher who ran his own computer lab in Rawalpindi. He cultivated my interest by letting me watch and later play classic games like GTA Vice City, House of the Dead, Virtua Cop 2, Midtown Madness, SEGA Master Collection, Crazy Taxi, and Twisted Metal. This early exposure wasn't just entertainment—it was the foundation of my lifelong passion for technology.

The geographical distance between Jhelum and Rawalpindi created my first technical challenge: limited access to computers. When my uncle gifted me a high-specification PC for that era, it came with Windows XP and its notorious configuration complexities. This limitation became my greatest teacher—without internet or strong English skills, I learned to troubleshoot, configure games, and resolve system issues independently. I observed local tech experts when called for help, often finding myself more capable than them. This was when I transitioned from being a gamer to becoming a self-taught technician.

### The Awakening (Teenage Years)
My teenage years marked a revolutionary shift. Watching "Inkeshaaf" on 24 News, where a professional hacker demonstrated system vulnerabilities, opened my eyes to the vast possibilities of technology beyond gaming. This sparked my passion for ethical hacking and cybersecurity. I set an ambitious goal: hack my Android phone from another Android phone—a challenge many considered impossible without traditional computing resources.

Over the course of a year, I:
- Mastered Linux ecosystem and CLI for both Windows and Linux
- Learned Python, batch scripting, bash scripting, and shell scripting
- Studied networking fundamentals and security protocols
- Pioneered mobile-to-mobile penetration testing techniques
- Created the second most-read article on Null Byte (2018-2020)
- Founded and led an international cybersecurity community spanning Iran, Pakistan, India, Australia, Finland, and Bangladesh

### The Academic Excellence (University Years 2019-2023)
At the University of the Punjab, Jhelum Campus, I transformed from an enthusiast to a professional:
- Achieved CGPA of 3.73/4.0 while going far beyond curriculum requirements
- Became unofficial teaching assistant for C++ in my second semester
- Served as deputy class representative, managing online classes during COVID-19
- Conducted specialized programming sessions for peers
- Simultaneously completed final year project (Costaz) and two research papers
- Collaborated with visiting PhD professor on quantum computing and photonics simulations

### The Professional Evolution (2023-Present)
My transition to industry was strategic and calculated:
- **TeqHolic Internship:** Gained industry experience in Flutter development
- **Rev9 Solutions Opportunity:** Offered AI team position, used as leverage
- **ACE Money Transfer:** Selected immediately by CTO, chose financial stability and growth
- Currently serving as .NET Developer & Architecture Consultant, transforming enterprise systems
- One of the defining achievements of this phase was devoting an entire year to engineering the Employee Monitoring Suite, a system I consider a professional masterpiece due to its blend of design elegance, technical depth, and measurable impact across the company.
